/**
 * #include_drs directives are used in the built-in random maps to load standard resources and stuff.
 * They are ignored when used in custom maps. However, some people still copy them by mistake.
 * It might be a good idea to parse them with a warning.
 * It should be possible to feed Mangudai any map, so this directive shouldn't cause an error.
